## I. Learning

# HTML/CSS/JS through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

After today, going to switch to Daily Updates for this.

What I've learned so far:

* Set Up Ubuntu VM + Command Line Basics
* Git Basics
* HTML Foundations
* CSS Foundations
* Flexbox


Currently on the flexbox project: building a landing page (put under
projects after a repository is made).

## II. LeetCode

[876. Middle of The Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

On first glance my idea was just to get length of the list (by traversing it) and then iterating halfway through again before returning. Instead found the idea of utilizing two pointers instead, one which goes twice as fast through the list, then returning the slower pointer's head once the fast one reaches the end.

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        while (fast && fast->next) {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }
        return slow;

    }
};
```

[383. Ransom Note](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/)

unordered_map<type, type> as the C++ equivalent for python dictionary

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool canConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {
        unordered_map<char, int> map;
        for (char c : magazine) {
            // .find returns an iterator to the requested element
            // if none found, returns past the end iterator, which is equivalent to .end
            if (map.find(c) == map.end()) {
                map[c] = 1;
            } else {
                map[c]++;
            }
        }

        for (char c : ransomNote) {
            if (map.find(c) != map.end() && map[c] > 0) {
                map[c]--;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```
