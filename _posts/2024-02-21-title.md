> Making a pivot to focus on relearning and building projects in Python.
> Will continue learning Web Dev and C++ at a lower priority.

> ## Main:
> * Learn Python through Boot.Dev
> * Practice Python through LeetCode (Daily!)
> * Build Projects in Python

> ## Side:
> * Learn HTML/CSS/JS through The Odin Project
> * Build & Clone Games in C++

> ## Current Goal:
> * Game Dev / Jr SWE 

## I. Learning

# Python through [Boot.Dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend)

Currently on **Loops**.

Completed Today:
* Introduction
* Variables
* Functions
* Scope
* Testing and Debugging
* Computing
* Comparisons

# HTML/CSS/JS through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

No Update.

Currently on the flexbox project: building a landing page (put under
projects after a repository is made).

## II. LeetCode

Daily Question

[997. Find the Town Judge](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-22)

<!-- Optional Discussion -->

My initial solution using a single array:

```
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # create array where index is person, value is number of people who trust them
        # if they trust someone else, make them -1
        trust_array = [0]*n

        for pair in trust:
            if (trust_array[pair[1]-1] != -1):
                trust_array[pair[1]-1] += 1
            trust_array[pair[0]-1] = -1
        
        if (n-1 in trust_array):
            return trust_array.index(n-1)+1

        return -1
```

My revised solution using two dictionaries.

```
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # revised solution, using two dictionaries
        outgoing = defaultdict(int) # handles out of bound errors so we don't need to check if a/b in dict
        incoming = defaultdict(int)

        for a,b in trust:
                outgoing[a] += 1   
                incoming[b] += 1
        
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if incoming[i] == n-1 and outgoing[i] == 0: return i

        return -1
```

I thought this was an interesting solution, looks simple.

```
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        temp = [1]*(n+1)
        for (a,b) in trust:
            temp[a] = -1 # even though [a] can still go up in future iterations, it will now never reach judge status
            temp[b] += 1

        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if temp[i] == n:
                return i  
        return -1
```

## III. Projects

# [SFML_Timber](https://github.com/Edyth-K/SFML_Timber) 

*C++ Timberman Clone with SFML*

No Daily Update

# Discord Bot (?)

Still more of an idea, but thinking about making a Discord Bot which can join voice channels and provide live CC.
