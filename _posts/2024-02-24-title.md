## I. Learning

# Python through [Boot.Dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend)

Finished Shells/ Terminals. Finished OOP. Functional Programming next.

Completed Today:
* Programs
* Package Managers (Shells/ Terminals ends here)
* Classes
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

[Boot.Dev Book and Library Class Example](https://www.boot.dev/assignments/d0da006c-6562-41c0-a7f6-93e795cf078d)

```
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author

class Library:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.books = []
        
    def add_book(self, book):
        self.books.append(book)

    def remove_book(self, book):
        for obj in self.books:
            if (obj.title == book.title and obj.author == book.author):
                self.books.remove(obj)
    
    def search_books(self, search_string):
        search_result = []
        for book in self.books:
            if (search_string.lower() in book.title.lower() or search_string.lower() in book.author.lower()):
                search_result.append(book)
        return search_result
```

# HTML/CSS/JS through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
