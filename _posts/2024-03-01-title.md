## I. Learning

# Python through [Boot.Dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend)

Starting Functional Programming next.

# Learning Godot through the Documentation

Learned Today:
* Introduction
* Nodes and Scenes
* Creating Instances
* First Script

Currently On: **Listening to Player Input**

# HTML/CSS/JS through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

Honestly considering dropping, as I want to focus more on back-end, but should at least finish JS portion for fundamentals.

Currently on the flexbox project: building a landing page (put under
projects after a repository is made).
